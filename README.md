- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
- Reacting to input events
the syntax for reacting to changes made in the input field known as "oninput" or "input"
```js
addEventListener("input", myScript)
```
for event listeners to react to changes made in the `<input type="text">`

this event is similar to the **onchange** event. The difference is that the oninput event occurs immediately after the value of an element has changed, while onchange occurs when the element loses focus, after the content has been changed. The other difference is that the onchange event also works on `<select>` elements.

```js
includes(value)
(e)=> {
e.target
}
```


```js
(e)=> {
e.target
}
```
